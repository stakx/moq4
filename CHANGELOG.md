# Moq Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## Unreleased

#### Added

 * A mock's setups can now be inspected and individually verified via the new `Mock.Setups` collection and `IInvocation.WasMatched` method (@stakx, #984-#987, #989)

 * New `.Protected().Setup` and `Protected().Verify` method overloads to deal with generic methods (@JmlSaul, #967)

 * Two new public methods in `Times`: `bool Validate(int count)` and `string ToString()` (@stakx, 975)

#### Fixed

 * Regression: Restored `Capture.In` use in `mock.Verify(expression, ...)` to extract arguments of previously recorded invocations. (@vgriph, #968; @stakx, #974)

 * Consistency: When mocking a class `C` whose constructor invokes one of its virtual members, `Mock.Of<C>()` now operates like `new Mock<C>()`: a record of such invocations is retained in the mock's `Invocations` collection (@stakx, #980)

## 4.13.1 (2019-10-19)

#### Fixed

* `SetupAllProperties` does not recognize property as read-write if only setter is overridden (@stakx, #886)

* Regression: `InvalidCastException` caused by Moq erroneously reusing a cached auto-mocked (`DefaultValue.Mock`) return value for a different generic method instantiation (@BrunoJuchli, #932)

* AmbiguousMatchException when setting up the property, that hides another one (@ishatalkin, #939)

* `ArgumentException` ("Interface not found") when setting up `object.ToString` on an interface mock (@vslynko, #942)

* Cannot "return" to original mocked type after downcasting with `Mock.Get` and then upcasting with `mock.As<>` (@pjquirk, #943)

* `params` arrays in recursive setup expressions are matched by reference equality instead of by structural equality (@danielcweber, #946)

* `mock.SetupProperty` throws `NullReferenceException` when called for partially overridden property (@stakx, #951)


## 4.13.0 (2019-08-31)

#### Changed

* Improved error message that is supplied with `ArgumentException` thrown when `Setup` or `Verify` are called on a protected method if the method could not be found with both the name and compatible argument types specified (@thomasfdm, #852).

* `mock.Invocations.Clear()` now removes traces of previous invocations more thoroughly by additionally resetting all setups to an "unmatched" state. (@stakx, #854)

* Consistent `Callback` delegate validation regardless of whether or not `Callback` is preceded by a `Returns`: Validation for post-`Returns` callback delegates used to be very relaxed, but is now equally strict as in the pre-`Returns` case.) (@stakx, #876)

* Subscription to mocked events used to be handled less strictly than subscription to regular CLI events. As with the latter, subscribing to mocked events now also requires all handlers to have the same delegate type. (@stakx, #891)

* Moq will throw when it detects that an argument matcher will never match anything due to the presence of an implicit conversion operator. (@michelcedric, #897, #898)

* New algorithm for matching invoked methods against methods specified in setup/verification expressions. (@stakx, #904)

#### Added

* Added support for setup and verification of the event handlers through `Setup[Add|Remove]` and `Verify[Add|Remove|All]` (@lepijohnny, #825) 

* Added support for lambda expressions while creating a mock through `new Mock<SomeType>(() => new SomeType("a", "b"))` and `repository.Create<SomeType>(() => new SomeType("a", "b"))`. This makes the process of mocking a class without a parameterless constructor simpler (compiler syntax checker...). (@frblondin, #884)

* Support for matching generic type arguments: `mock.Setup(m => m.Method<It.IsAnyType>(...))`. (@stakx, #908)

   The standard type matchers are:

   - `It.IsAnyType` &mdash; matches any type
   - `It.IsSubtype<T>` &mdash; matches `T` and proper subtypes of `T`
   - `It.IsValueType` &mdash; matches only value types

   You can create your own custom type matchers:

   ```csharp
   [TypeMatcher]
   class Either<A, B> : ITypeMatcher
   {
       public bool Matches(Type type) => type == typeof(A) || type == typeof(B);
   }
   ```

* In order to support type matchers (see bullet point above), some new overloads have been added to existing methods:

   - `setup.Callback(new InvocationAction(invocation => ...))`,  
     `setup.Returns(new InvocationFunc(invocation => ...))`:

      The lambda specified in these new overloads will receive an `IInvocation` representing the current invocation from which type arguments as well as arguments can be discovered.

   - `Match.Create<T>((object argument, Type parameterType) => ..., ...)`,  
     `It.Is<T>((object argument, Type parameterType) => ...)`:

      Used to create custom matchers that work with type matchers. When a type matcher is used for `T`, the `argument` received by the custom matchers is untyped (`object`), and its actual type (or rather the type of the parameter for which the argument was passed) is provided via an additional parameter `parameterType`. (@stakx, #908)

#### Fixed

* Moq does not mock explicit interface implementation and `protected virtual` correctly. (@oddbear, #657)

* `Invocations.Clear()` does not cause `Verify` to fail (@jchessir, #733)

* Regression: `SetupAllProperties` can no longer set up properties whose names start with `Item`. (@mattzink, #870; @kaan-kaya, #869)

* Regression: `MockDefaultValueProvider` will no longer attempt to set `CallBase` to true for mocks generated for delegates. (@dammejed, #874)

* `Verify` throws `TargetInvocationException` instead of `MockException` when one of the recorded invocations was to an async method that threw. (@Cufeadir, #883)

* Moq does not distinguish between distinct events if they have the same name (@stakx, #893)

* Regression in 4.12.0: `SetupAllProperties` removes indexer setups. (@stakx, #901)

* Parameter types are ignored when matching an invoked generic method against setups. (@stakx, #903)

* For `[Value]Task<object>`, `.ReturnsAsync(null)` throws `NullReferenceException` instead of producing a completed task with result `null` (@voroninp, #909)


## 4.12.0 (2019-06-20)

#### Changed

* Improved performance for `Mock.Of<T>` and `mock.SetupAllProperties()` as the latter now performs property setups just-in-time, instead of as an ahead-of-time batch operation. (@vanashimko, #826)
* Setups with no `.Returns(â€¦)` nor `.CallBase()` no longer return `default(T)` for loose mocks, but a value that is consistent with the mock's `CallBase` and `DefaultValue[Provider]` settings. (@stakx, #849)

#### Added

* New method overload `sequenceSetup.ReturnsAsync(Func<T>)` (@stakx, #841)
* LINQ to Mocks support for strict mocks, i.e. new method overloads for `Mock.Of`, `Mocks.Of`, `mockRepository.Of`, and `mockRepository.OneOf` that accept a `MockBehavior` parameter. (@stakx, #842)

#### Fixed

* Adding `Callback` to a mock breaks async tests (@marcin-chwedczuk-meow, #702)
* `mock.SetupAllProperties()` now setups write-only properties for strict mocks, so that accessing such properties will not throw anymore. (@vanashimko, #836)
* Regression: `mock.SetupAllProperties()` and `Mock.Of<T>` fail due to inaccessible property accessors (@Mexe13, #845)
* Regression: `VerifyNoOtherCalls` causes stack overflow when mock setup returns the mocked object (@bash, #846)
* `Capture.In()` no longer captures arguments when other setup arguments do not match (@ocoanet, #844).
* `CaptureMatch` no longer invokes the capture callback when other setup arguments do not match (@ocoanet, #844).


## 4.11.0 (2019-05-28)

Same as 4.11.0-rc2. See changelog entries for the below two pre-release versions.


## 4.11.0-rc2 (2019-05-27)

This is a pre-release version.

#### Changed

* Debug symbols (`Moq.pdb`) have moved into a separate NuGet symbol package (as per the current official [guideline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/symbol-packages-snupkg)). If you want the Visual Studio debugger to step into Moq's source code, disable Just My Code, enable SourceLink, and configure [NuGet's symbol server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/symbol-packages-snupkg#nugetorg-symbol-server). (@stakx, #789)

#### Fixed

* Regression: Unhelpful exception message when setting up an indexer with `SetupProperty` (@stakx, #823)


## 4.11.0-rc1 (2019-04-19)

This is a pre-release version.

It contains several minor breaking changes, and there have been extensive internal rewrites in order to fix some very long-standing bugs in relation to argument matchers in fluent setup expressions.

#### Changed

* The library now targets .NET Standard 2.0 instead of .NET Standard 1.x. This has been decided based on the official [cross-platform targeting guideline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/cross-platform-targeting) and the [End of Life announcement for .NET Core 1.x](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-1-0-and-1-1-will-reach-end-of-life-on-june-27-2019/) (@stakx, #784, #785)
* Method overload resolution may change for:
    - `mock.Protected().Setup("VoidMethod", ...)`
    - `mock.Protected().Verify("VoidMethod", ...)`
    - `mock.Protected().Verify<TResult>("NonVoidMethod", ...)`

   due to a new overload: If the first argument is a `bool`, make sure that argument gets interpreted as part of `args`, not as `exactParameterMatch` (see also *Added* section below). (@stakx & @Shereef, #751, #753)
* `mock.Verify[All]` now performs a more thorough error aggregation. Error messages of inner/recursive mocks are included in the error message using indentation to show the relationship between mocks. (@stakx, #762)
* `mock.Verify` no longer creates setups, nor will it override existing setups, as a side-effect of using a recursive expression. (@stakx, #765)
* More accurate detection of argument matchers with `SetupSet` and `VerifySet`, especially when used in fluent setup expressions or with indexers (@stakx, #767)
* `mock.Verify(expression)` error messages now contain a full listing of all invocations that occurred across all involved mocks. Setups are no longer listed, since they are completely irrelevant in the context of call verification. (@stakx, #779, #780)
* Indexers used as arguments in setup expressions are now eagerly evaluated, like all other properties already are (except when they refer to matchers) (@stakx, #794)
* Update package reference to `Castle.Core` (DynamicProxy) from version 4.3.1 to 4.4.0 (@stakx, #797)

#### Added

* New method overloads:
   - `mock.Protected().Setup("VoidMethod", exactParameterMatch, args)`
   - `mock.Protected().Verify("VoidMethod", times, exactParameterMatch, args)`
   - `mock.Protected().Verify<TResult>("NonVoidMethod", times, exactParameterMatch, args)`

   having a `bool exactParameterMatch` parameter. Due to method overload resolution, it was easy to think this already existed when in fact it did not, leading to failing tests. (@Shereef & @stakx, #753, #751)
* Ability in `mock.Raise` and `setup.Raises` to raise events on sub-objects (inner mocks) (@stakx, #772)

#### Removed

* Pex interop (which has not been maintained for years). You might notice changes when using Visual Studio's IntelliTest feature. (@stakx, #786)

#### Fixed

* Setting multiple indexed object's property directly via LINQ fails (@TylerBrinkley, #314)
* `InvalidOperationException` when specifiying setup on mock with mock containing property of type `Nullable<T>` (@dav1dev, #725)
* `Verify` gets confused between the same generic and non-generic signature (@lepijohnny, #749)
* Setup gets included in `Verify` despite being "unreachable" (@stakx, #703)
* `Verify` can create setups that cause subsequent `VerifyAll` to fail (@stakx & @lepijohnny, #699)
* Incomplete stack trace when raising an event with `mock.Raise` throws (@MutatedTomato, #738)
* `Mock.Raise` only raises events on root object (@hallipr, #166)
* Mocking indexer captures `It.IsAny()` as the value, even if given in the indexer argument (@idigra, #696)
* `VerifySet` fails on non-trivial property setup (@TimothyHayes, #430)
* Use of `SetupSet` 'forgets' method setup (@TimothyHayes, #432)
* Recursive mocks don't work with argument matching (@thalesmello, #142)
* Recursive property setup overrides previous setups (@jamesfoster, #110)
* Formatting of enumerable object for error message broke EF Core test case (@MichaelSagalovich, #741)
* `Verify[All]` fails because of lazy (instead of eager) setup argument expression evaluation (@aeslinger, #711)
* `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` when setup expression contains indexer access (@mosentok, #714)
* Incorrect implementation of `Times.Equals` (@stakx, #805)


## 4.10.1 (2018-12-03)

#### Fixed

* `NullReferenceException` when using `SetupSet` on indexers with multiple parameters (@idigra, #694)
* `CallBase` should not be allowed for delegate mocks (@tehmantra, #706)

#### Changed

* Dropped the dependency on the `System.ValueTuple` NuGet package, at no functional cost (i.e. value tuples are still supported just fine) (@stakx, #721)
* Updated failure messages to show richer class names (@powerdude, #727)
* Upgraded `System.Reflection.TypeExtensions` and `System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions` dependencies to versions 4.5.1 (@stakx, #729)


## 4.10.0 (2018-09-08)

#### Added

* `ExpressionCompiler`: An extensibility point for setting up alternate LINQ expression tree compilation strategies (@stakx, #647)
* `setup.CallBase()` for `void` methods (@stakx, #664)
* `VerifyNoOtherCalls` for `MockRepository` (@BlythMeister, #682)

#### Changed

* Make `VerifyNoOtherCalls` take into account previous calls to parameterless `Verify()` and `VerifyAll()` (@stakx, #659)
* **Breaking change:** `VerifyAll` now succeeds after a call to `SetupAllProperties` even when not all property accessors were invoked (stakx, #684)

#### Fixed

* More precise `out` parameter detection for mocking COM interfaces with `[in,out]` parameters (@koutinho, #645)
* Prevent false 'Different number of parameters' error with `Returns` callback methods that have been compiled from `Expression`s (@stakx, #654)
* `Verify` exception should report configured setups for delegate mocks (@stakx, #679)
* `Verify` exception should include complete call expression for delegate mocks (@stakx, #680)
* Bug report #556: "Recursive setup expression creates ghost setups that make `VerifyAll` fail" (@stakx, #684)
* Bug report #191: "Upgrade from 4.2.1409.1722 to 4.2.1507.0118 changed `VerifyAll` behavior" (@stakx, #684)


## 4.9.0 (2018-07-13)

#### Added

* Add `Mock.Invocations` property to support inspection of invocations on a mock (@Tragedian, #560)

#### Changed

* Update package reference to `Castle.Core` (DynamicProxy) from version 4.3.0 to 4.3.1 (@stakx, #635)
* Floating point values are formatted with higher precision (satisfying round-tripping) in diagnostic messages (@stakx, #637)

#### Fixed

* `CallBase` disregarded for some base methods from non-public interfaces (@stakx, #641)

#### Obsoleted

* `mock.ResetCalls()` has been deprecated in favor of `mock.Invocations.Clear()` (@stakx, #633)


## 4.8.3 (2018-06-09)

#### Added

* Add `ISetupSequentialResult<TResult>.Returns` method overload that support delegate for deferred results (@snrnats, #594)
* Support for C# 7.2's `in` parameter modifier (@stakx, #624, #625)
* Missing methods `ReturnsAsync` and `ThrowsAsync` for sequential setups of methods returning a `ValueTask` (@stakx, #626) 

#### Changed

* **Breaking change:** All `ReturnsAsync` and `ThrowsAsync` setup methods now consistently return a new `Task` on each invocation (@snrnats, #595) 
* Speed up `Mock.Of<T>()` by approx. one order of magnitude (@informatorius, #598)
* Update package reference to `Castle.Core` (DynamicProxy) from version 4.2.1 to 4.3.0 (@stakx, #624)

#### Fixed

*  Usage of `ReturnsExtensions.ThrowsAsync()` can cause `UnobservedTaskException` (@snrnats, #595)
*  `ReturnsAsync` and `ThrowsAsync` with delay parameter starts timer at setup (@snrnats, #595)
*  `Returns` regression with null function callback (@Caraul, #602)


## 4.8.2 (2018-02-23)

#### Changed

* Upgraded `System.ValueTuple` dependency to version 4.4.0 in order to reestablish Moq compatibility with .NET 4.7 (and later), which already include the `ValueTuple` types (@stakx, #591)

#### Fixed

* Wrong parameters count for extension methods in `Callback` and `Returns` (@Caraul, #575)
* `CallBase` regression with members of additional interfaces (@stakx, #583)


## 4.8.1 (2018-01-08)

#### Added

* C# 7 tuple support for `DefaultValue.Empty` and `DefaultValue.Mock` (@stakx, #563)

#### Changed

* Downgraded `System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions` and `System.ValueTuple` dependencies to versions 4.3.0 as suggested by @tothdavid in order to improve Moq compatibility with .NET 4.6.1 / help prevent `MissingMethodException` and similar (@stakx, #571)

#### Fixed

* `CallBase` regression with explicitly implemented interface methods (@stakx, #558)


## 4.8.0 (2017-12-24)

Same as 4.8.0-rc1 (see below), plus some significant speed improvements.

#### Changed

* `SetupAllProperties` now fully supports property type recursion / loops in the object graph, thanks to deferred property initialization (@stakx, #550)


## 4.8.0-rc1 (2017-12-08)

This is a pre-release version.

#### Added

* Support for sequential setup of `void` methods (@alexbestul, #463)
* Support for sequential setups (`SetupSequence`) of protected members (@stakx, #493)
* Support for callbacks for methods having `ref` or `out` parameters via two new overloads of `Callback` and `Returns` (@stakx, #468)
* Improved support for setting up and verifying protected members (including generic methods and methods having by-ref parameters) via the new duck-typing `mock.Protected().As<TAnalog>()` interface (@stakx, #495, #501)
* Support for `ValueTask<TResult>` when using the `ReturnsAsync` extension methods, similar to `Task<TResult>` (@AdamDotNet, #506)
* Special handling for `ValueTask<TResult>` with `DefaultValue.Empty` (@stakx, #529)
* Support for custom default value generation strategies besides `DefaultValue.Empty` and `DefaultValue.Mock`:
  Implement custom providers by subclassing either `DefaultValueProvider` or `LookupOrFallbackDefaultValueProvider`,
  install them by setting `Mock[Repository].DefaultValueProvider` (@stakx, #533, #536)
* Allow `DefaultValue.Mock` to mock `Task<TMockable>` and `ValueTask<TMockable>` (@stakx, #502)
* Match any value for `ref` parameters with `It.Ref<T>.IsAny` (or `ItExpr.Ref<T>.IsAny` for protected methods) as you would with `It.IsAny<T>()` for regular parameters (@stakx, #537) 
* `Mock.VerifyNoOtherCalls()` to check whether all expected invocations have been verified -- can be used as an alternative to `MockBehavior.Strict` (@stakx, #539)

#### Changed

* **Breaking change:** `SetupSequence` now overrides pre-existing setups like all other `Setup` methods do. This means that exhausted sequences no longer fall back to previous setups to produce a "default" action or return value. (@stakx, #476)
* Delegates passed to `Returns` are validated a little more strictly than before (return type and parameter count must match with method being set up) (@stakx, #520)
* Change assembly versioning scheme to `major.minor.0.0` to help prevent assembly version conflicts and to reduce the need for binding redirects (@stakx, #554)

#### Fixed

* Update a method's invocation count correctly, even when it is set up to throw an exception (@stakx, #473)
* Sequences set up with `SetupSequence` are now thread-safe (@stakx, #476)
* Record calls to methods that are named like event accessors (`add_X`, `remove_X`) so they can be verified (@stakx, #488)
* Improve recognition logic for sealed methods so that `Setup` throws when an attempt is made to set one up (@stakx, #497)
* Let `SetupAllProperties` skip inaccessible methods (@stakx, #499)
* Prevent Moq from relying on a mock's implementation of `IEnumerable<T>` (@stakx, #510)
* Verification leaked internal `MockVerificationException` type; remove it (@stakx, #511)
* Custom matcher properties not printed correctly in error messages (@stakx, #517)
* Infinite loop when invoking delegate in `Mock.Of` setup expression (@stakx, #528) 

#### Obsoleted

* `[Matcher]` has been deprecated in favor of `Match.Create` (@stakx, #514)


## 4.7.145 (2017-11-06)

#### Changed

* Moq no longer collects source file information for verification error messages by default. A current .NET Framework regression (https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/issues/529) makes this extremely costly, so this is now an opt-in feature; see `Switches.CollectSourceFileInfoForSetups` (@stakx, #515)

#### Added

* `Mock.Switches` and `MockRepository.Switches`, which allow opting in and out of certain features (@stakx, #515)


## 4.7.142 (2017-10-11)

#### Changed

* Update package reference to `Castle.Core` (DynamicProxy) from version 4.2.0 to 4.2.1 due to a regression; see castleproject/Core#309 for details (@stakx, #482)

#### Fixed

* `TypeLoadException`s ("Method does not have an implementation") caused by the regression above, see e.g. #469 (@stakx, #482)


## 4.7.137 (2017-09-30)

#### Changed

* Update package reference to `Castle.Core` (DynamicProxy) from version 4.1.1 to 4.2.0, which uses a new assembly versioning scheme that should eventually reduce assembly version conflicts and the need for assembly binding redirects (@stakx, #459)

#### Fixed

* `mock.Object` should always return the exact same proxy object, regardless of whether the mock has been cast to an interface via `.As<T>()` or not (@stakx, #460)


## 4.7.127 (2017-09-26)

#### Changed

* Make setups for inaccessible internal members fail fast by throwing an exception (@stakx, #455)

#### Removed

* The redundant type `ObsoleteMockException` has been removed (@stakx)

#### Fixed

* Make `SetupAllProperties` work correctly for same-typed sibling properties (@stakx, #442)
* Switch back from portable PDBs to classic PDBs for better compatibility of SourceLink with older .NET tools (@stakx, #443)
* Make strict mocks recognize that `.CallBase()` can set up a return value, too (@stakx, #450)


## 4.7.99 (2017-07-17)

#### Added

* Add `[NeutralResourcesLanguage]` to assembly info for portable library use (@benbillbob, #394)
* Add portable, [SourceLink](https://github.com/ctaggart/SourceLink)-ed debugging symbols (PDB) to NuGet package, enabling end users to step into Moq's source code (@stakx, #417)

#### Changed

* Move all hardcoded message strings to `Resources.resx` (@stakx, #403)
* Update package reference to `Castle.Core` (DynamicProxy) from version 4.1.0 to 4.1.1 (@stakx, #416)
* Clean up and simplify the build process by merging separate .NET Framework and .NET Standard projects (@stakx, #417)
* Replace outdated `ReleaseNotes.md` with new `CHANGELOG.md` (@stakx, #423)

#### Fixed

* Fix member name typo in reflection code (@JohanLarsson, #389)
* Make `Interceptor` more thread-safe during `mock.Setup` (@stakx, #392)
* Make abstract events defined in classes work even when `CallBase` is true by suppressing `InvokeBase()` (@stakx, #395)
* Allow setting up null return values using `Mock.Of` (@stakx, #396)
* Allow `Mock<T>.Raise` to raise events on child mocks instead of raising no or the wrong event (@stakx, #397)
* Improve specificity of `Setup` / `Verify` exception messages for static members and extension methods (@stakx, #400)
* Prevent internal interception on a mock from changing its `DefaultValue` property (@vladonemo, #411)
* Prevent stack overflow in conditional setups (@stakx, #412)
* Fix `NullReferenceException` caused by internally relying on a mock's `IEnumerable` implementation (@stakx, #413)
* Improve method match accuracy in `ExtractProxyCall` so that the order of setting up methods in an hierarchy of interfaces does not matter (@stakx, #415) 
* Improve mockability of C++/CLI interfaces having custom modifiers (`modopt`, `modreq`) in their method signatures (@stakx, #416)
* Make types implementing the same generic type more than two times mockable (@stakx, #416)
* Fix misreported `Times` in verification error messages (@stakx, #417)


## 4.7.63 (2017-06-21)

#### Changed

* Ensure that `null` never matches an `It.IsRegex(â€¦)` (@stakx, #385)

#### Fixed

* Fix mocking of non-virtual methods via `mock.As<TInterface>()` which was broken by #381 (@stakx, #387)

#### Fixed

* Fix formatting inconsistencies for array values in `MockException.Message` (@stakx, #380)
* Fix major "class method vs. interface method" bug introduced by #119 / commit 162a543 (@stakx, #381)
* Fix mocking for redeclared interface properties (get-set but get-only in base type) (@stakx, #382)


## 4.7.49 (2017-06-18)

#### Fixed

* Fix incorrect Castle.Core package reference in NuGet package specification (@stakx, #379)


## 4.7.46 (2017-06-18)

#### Changed

* Extend `EmptyDefaultValueProvider` so it understands multidimensional arrays (return empty multidimensional arrays instead of `null`) (@stakx, #360)
* Update package reference to `Castle.Core` (DynamicProxy) from version 4.0.0 to 4.1.0, update `System` and `Microsoft` packages from versions 4.0.1 to 4.3.0 (@stakx, #369)
* Clean up and reduce usage of conditional compilation (`#if`) (@stakx, #378)

#### Fixed

* Ensure default mock names are (more) unique (@stakx, #359)
* Make `It.IsAny`, `It.IsNotNull` work for COM types (@stakx, #361)
* Fix equality check bug in `ExpressionKey` which meant Moq would sometimes ignore exact argument order in setups (@kostadinmarinov, #135; @stakx, #363)
* Ensure incorrect implementations of `ISerializable` are caught properly (@stakx, #370)
* Make event accessor recognition logic more correct (don't just rely on `add_` or `remove_` name prefixes) (@stakx, #376)


## 4.7.25 (2017-06-03)

#### Added

* Add new `setup.ReturnsAsync` and `setup.ThrowsAsync` overloads allowing you to specify a delay (@jochenz, #289)

**Note:** The release notes for some Moq versions 4.6.*-alpha are still missing. They need to be
reconstructed from the commit history and the GitHub issue archive. If you would like to help make
this changelog more complete, any pull requests towards that goal are appreciated!

* Substantially improved property setter behavior: `mock.VerifySet(foo => foo.Value = "foo");` (also available for `SetupSet`
* Renamed `Expect*` with `Setup*`
* Vastly simplified custom argument matchers: `public int IsOdd() { return Match<int>.Create(v => i % 2 == 0); }`

* Added simple sample app named StoreSample
* Moved Stub functionality to the core API (`SetupProperty` and `SetupAllProperties`)
* Fixed sample ASP.NET MVC app to work with latest version
* Allow custom matchers to be created with a substantially simpler API
* Fixed issue #145 which prevented discrimination of setups by generic method argument types
* Fixed issue #141 which prevented ref arguments matching value types (i.e. a Guid)
* Implemented improvement #131: Add support for `It.IsAny` and custom argument matchers for `SetupSet`/`VerifySet`
* Implemented improvement #124 to render better error messages
* Applied patch from David Kirkland for improvement #125 to improve matching of enumerable parameters
* Implemented improvement #122 to provide custom errors for `Verify`
* Implemented improvement #121 to provide `null` as default value for `Nullable<T>`
* Fixed issue #112 which fixes passing a null argument to a mock constructor
* Implemented improvement #111 to better support params arguments
* Fixed bug #105 about improperly overwriting setups for property getter and setter
* Applied patch from Ihar.Bury for issue #99 related to protected expectations 
* Fixed issue #97 on not being able to use `SetupSet`/`VerifySet` if property did not have a getter
* Better integration with Pex (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/Pex/)
* Various other minor fixes (#134, #135, #137, #138, #140, etc.)

## 2.6

* Implemented Issue #55: We now provide a `mock.DefaultValue` = [`DefaultValue.Empty` | `DefaultValue.Mock`] which will provide the current behavior (default) or mocks for mockeable return types for loose mock invocations without expectations.
* Added support for stubbing properties from moq-contrib: now you can do `mock.Stub(m => m.Value)` and add stub behavior to the property. `mock.StubAll()` is also provided. This integrates with the `DefaultValue` behavior too, so you can stub entire hierarchies :).
* Added support for mocking methods with `out` and `ref` parameters (Issue #50)
* Applied patch contributed by slava for Issue #72: add support to limit numbor of calls on mocked method (we now have `mock.Expect(...).AtMost(5)`)
* Implemented Issue #94: Easier setter verification: Now we support `ExpectSet(m = m.Value, "foo")` and `VerifySet(m = m.Value, 5)` (Thanks ASP.NET MVC Team!)
* Implemented issue #96: Automatically chain mocks when setting expectations. It's now possible to specify expectations for an entire hierarchy of objects just starting from the root mock. THIS IS REALLY COOL!!!
* Fixed Issue #89: `Expects()` does not always return last expectation
* Implemented Issue 91: Expect a method/property to never be called (added `Never()` method to an expectation. Can be used on methods, property getters and setters)
* Fixed Issue 86: `IsAny<T>` should check if the value is actually of type `T`
* Fixed Issue 88: Cannot mock protected internal virtual methods using `Moq.Protected`
* Fixed Issue 90: Removing event handlers from mocked objects
* Updated demo and added one more test for the dynamic addition of interfaces

## 2.5

* Added support for mocking protected members
* Added new way of extending argument matchers which is now very straightforward
* Added support for mocking events
* Added support for firing events from expectations
* Removed usage of MBROs which caused inconsistencies in mocking features
* Added `ExpectGet` and `ExpectSet` to better support properties, and provide better intellisense.
* Added verification with expressions, which better supports Arrange-Act-Assert testing model (can do `Verify(m => m.Do(...)))`
* Added `Throws<TException>`
* Added `mock.CallBase` property to specify whether the virtual members base implementation should be called
* Added support for implementing and setting expectations and verifying additional interfaces in the mock, via the new `mock.As<TInterface>()` method (thanks Fernando Simonazzi!)
* Improved argument type matching for `Is`/`IsAny` (thanks Jeremy.Skinner!)

## 2.0

* Refactored fluent API on mocks. This may cause some existing tests to fail, but the fix is trivial (just reorder the calls to `Callback`, `Returns` and `Verifiable`)
* Added support for retrieving a `Mock<T>` from a `T` instance created by a mock.
* Added support for retrieving the invocation arguments from a `Callback` or `Returns`.
* Implemented `AtMostOnce()` constraint 
* Added support for creating MBROs with protected constructors
* Loose mocks now return default empty arrays and `IEnumerables` instead of `null`s

## 1.5.1

* Refactored `MockFactory` to make it simpler and more explicit to use with regards to verification. Thanks Garry Shutler for the feedback! 

## 1.5

* Added `MockFactory` to allow easy construction of multiple mocks with the same behavior and verification 

## 1.4

* Added support for passing constructor arguments for mocked classes.
* Improved code documentation 

## 1.3

 * Added support for overriding expectations set previously on a Mock. Now adding a second expectation for the same method/property call will override the existing one. This facilitates setting up default expectations in a fixture setup and overriding when necessary in a specific test.
 * Added support for mock verification. Both `Verify` and `VerifyAll` are provided for more flexibility (the former only verifies methods marked `Verifiable`) 

## 1.2

* Added support for `MockBehavior` mock constructor argument to affect the way the mocks expect or throw on calls. 

## 1.1

* Merged branch for dynamic types. Now Moq is based on Castle DynamicProxy2 to support a wider range of mock targets.
* Added ILMerge so that Castle libraries are merged into Moq assembly (no need for external references and avoid conflicts)

## 1.0

* Initial release, initial documentation process in place, etc.
